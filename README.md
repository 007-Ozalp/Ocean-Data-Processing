# Ocean-Data-Processing

AdriaClim Project:

Climate change information, monitoring, and management tools for adaptation strategies in Adriatic coastal areas.

Data Management: Geoportal development, climate model data transformation, and visualization in the Adriatic Sea in the field of Climate, Ocean, and Coastal Areas. Therefore, in 007-Ozalp/Ocean-Data-Processing you will find some examples of how the information is processed for data manipulations and visualizations.
